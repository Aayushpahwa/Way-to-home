# TravelEase - Booking.com Clone

This is a simple front-end implementation of a travel booking website inspired by Booking.com. The project includes responsive HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to demonstrate the user interface and basic interactions.

## Project Structure

- `index.html` - The main homepage featuring search functionality, featured destinations, property listings, and Local Pulse
- `search-results.html` - The search results page showing filtered properties with sorting options
- `hotel-details.html` - Detailed view of a specific hotel with room selection options and destination-specific Local Pulse
- `css/styles.css` - Main stylesheet for the website
- `js/script.js` - JavaScript functionality for interactive elements

## Features

- Responsive design that works on mobile, tablet, and desktop
- Interactive search forms for finding accommodations
- Property filtering and sorting functionality
- Hotel gallery with image preview
- Room selection and booking interface
- User authentication UI elements (non-functional)
- Modern, clean design inspired by Booking.com
- **Local Pulse** - Real-time destination insights and data visualization

## Local Pulse Feature

The Local Pulse feature provides users with a live snapshot of the current cultural, social, and environmental "vibe" of any travel destination:

- **Weather & Mood Impact** - Current weather with travel activity suggestions
- **Cultural Events & Festivals** - Local events happening today or upcoming
- **Vibe Meter / Sentiment Index** - Social media sentiment analysis visualization
- **Crowd Density & Activity Levels** - Current activity levels in key areas
- **News Pulse** - Summarized local news and travel alerts 
- **Trending Music/Culture** - Top local tracks and cultural trends
- **Local Tip of the Day** - Curated insights from locals
- **City Comparison** - Compare cities by different vibe categories
- **Pulse Alerts** - Subscribe to notifications for desired vibes

## How to Run

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Open any of the HTML files in a web browser

No server or build process is required as this is a static front-end implementation.

## Implementation Notes

- This is a front-end only implementation focusing on the UI/UX
- The search, booking, and authentication features are simulated (no back-end)
- Local Pulse data is simulated with placeholder content and randomized updates
- Placeholder images are used throughout the site

## Technology Stack

- HTML5
- CSS3 (with flexbox and grid layouts)
- JavaScript (vanilla, no frameworks)
- Font Awesome for icons

## Future Enhancements

- Implement actual search functionality with a back-end
- Add real authentication system
- Connect Local Pulse to real APIs (weather, events, social media)
- Create more detail pages (flights, car rentals, etc.)
- Implement payment processing
- Add user reviews and ratings system
- Build historical vibe charts and trend analysis
- Create mobile app with push notifications for Pulse Alerts
