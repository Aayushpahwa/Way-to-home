# Local Pulse Feature Sheet

## Overview
Local Pulse is a dynamic feature that provides travelers with real-time insights about their destination. Acting like a "city vibe dashboard," it aggregates data from various sources to give users a comprehensive understanding of what's happening at their destination right now.

## Purpose
Local Pulse addresses a critical travel planning gap: understanding the current "feel" and conditions of a destination before and during a trip. This feature helps travelers:
- Make more informed decisions about when and where to visit
- Discover local events and activities happening during their stay
- Understand weather conditions and their impact on planned activities
- Monitor crowd levels at popular attractions
- Stay informed about local news that might affect their trip
- Connect with authentic local culture through music and insider tips
